"scientific method Worms mud?Last spring, heavy rains turned th e soil Maria’s backyard mud."
Maria noticed many worms cr awling top mud weren’t (Figure 1.6).
conclude worms made mud?
course not!
common scientific knowledge nonliving objects ( like mud) cannot turn living things (like worms).
"Bu hundreds years ag o, people actually thought simple living things like worms beetles came nonliving things like mud, dirt, spoiled food."
scientific methodWe often take scientific knowledge granted even though result work many sc ientists many years.
"scientific method process used scientists answer questions like, “Can nonliving object turn living thing?” involves asking questions, deve loping explanations, testing explanations see correct."
think scientific method organi zed way asking answering questions.
Untested observationsThe explanation nonliving object give rise living things based untested observations .
"scientists started using scientific method (in 1600s), eventually disproved idea."

Predator-prey relationshipsMost interactions specie community involve food.
Organisms hunt feed organisms called predators .
eaten called prey.
"green crab predator eats clams mu ssels, prey."
Predator-prey relationships help keep population growth balance.
"Introducing new species community, like green crab, upset balance."
"Competition Often, organisms th e different sp ecies vie food supply."
type interaction called competition .
"introduced new community , green crab competes native species crabs food."
"green cr ab successful, cause negative population growth crab species."
Types symbiosisThere many cases two species live together long periods time.
type interaction called symbiosis .
"symbiosis, one member always bene fits interaction."
"commensalism , member unaffected."
"mutualism , member helped."
"parasitism , member harmed."
"example, species barnacle parasite green crab native community (Europe North Africa)."
barnacles weaken crabs prevent reproducing.

"several functions: serve protective barrier infection, help keep bodies correct temperature, provide us sense touch."
"three main layers skin: epidermis, dermis, subcutaneous fat."
epidermis outer layer skin see.
"body cons tantly adds new cells layer 30,000-40,000 dead cells flake surface skin every minute."
"Th e epidermis also contains substance called melanin, gives skin color."
dermis tough stre tchy layer skin lies epidermis.
"derm contains nerve endings, blood vessels, oil glands, sweat glands."
bottom layer skin ca lled subcutaneous layer.
mostly contains fat help body stay warm.
subcutaneous layer also provides cushion protect body injury.
Degrees burns degree burn determined deeply penetrates skin.
Burn wound classified three depths.
"first-degree burn minor burn affects epidermis - sunburn, instance."
"Symptoms include redness, swelling, pain, peeling skin."
second-degree burn deeper causes damage skin.
Blisters occur second- degree burns damage dermis.
third-degree burn severe type burn.

Healing th ird-degree burns slow may result much scarring.
Chapter 17 Connection383Unit 6 HUMAN BODY Sources skin grafts Patients severe burns often treated skin grafts.
Surgeons specially trained treating burn victims perform procedures.
Skin grafts may involve taking healthy skin unburned part patient’s body placing damaged area.
"procedure also called autografting, “auto-” referring graft individual."
"Sometimes patients large burns enough undamaged skin autografting, skin taken human donor."
"called allograft, “allo-” referring donor species differe nt genetically."
"However, skin human donors always available, either."
Sometimes skin animal donor (such pig) used.
"called xenograft, “xeno-” referring donor another species."
problem donated skin risk infection; body’s immune system often rejects donated skin.
"New procedures fo r skin replacement 1987, procedure perm anent skin replacement developed involving creating large amounts skin laboratory using skin cells burn victim."
body less likely reject skin made patient’s cells.
labo ratory-created skin look function like normal skin.
"color may different patient’s, contain hai r follicles pores sweating.A system helps burn victims heal Integraâ Dermal Regeneration Template."
"replacement skin, made living cells."
provides protective covering patient’s cells grow.
"cells arrange layer similar normal, healthy dermis."
Scientists trying develop true artificial skin.
would work like normal skin could used treat large burn areas.
"Scientists hope create cells grow hair follicles sweat glands, look feel like normal skin."
Much research still done scientists hope artificial skin become available near future.
